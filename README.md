### Helpful Commands:

- **git branch** - shows all branches w/ \* next to current branch
- **git branch < branch_name >** - adds a new branch with said name
- **git checkout < branch_name >** - allows you to change over to that new branch
- **git merge < branch_name >** - will merge the branch that you are currently on with whatever name you input
  > Example: this is the command you will use after checking out to master in order to merge the branch you had been working on before... for example, while on master you can say " git merge navbar " etc.

### Important steps:

Note: before doing anything, make sure to clone the repo! Only need to do this ONE time at the very start.

1. Create a new branch
2. Checkout to that branch
3. Work, commit, push to that branch
4. When ready, git pull...
   > NOTE: You MUST git pull before checking out to the master branch and then merging.
5. Git checkout to master
6. Git merge
